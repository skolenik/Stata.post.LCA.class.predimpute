  title={STEP3: Stata module to relate latent class membership to external variables},
  year={2023},
  abstract={
    step3 performs two bias-adjusted three-step methods to relate latent
    class membership to external variables: Maximum Likelihood
    (ML; Vermunt, 2010) and Bolck-Croon-Hagenaars (BCH; Bolck et al.,
    2004). The external variables can be either covariates
    (predictors of class membership) or distal outcomes (predicted by
    class membership). The command adjusts for misclassification errors
    that arise in three-step approaches when observations are assigned
    to classes based on posterior probabilities from an initial latent
    class model. The first step (estimating the latent class model and
    predicting posterior probabilities) must be done separately
    (e.g., with gsem or fmm). step3 uses these predicted probabilities
    to construct a classification error matrix and fits the structural
    model via ML or BCH correction.

    Latent class analysis (LCA) is a statistical procedure used to
    identify qualitatively different subgroups within populations who
    often share certain outward characteristics. The assumption
    underlying LCA is that membership in unobserved groups (or classes)
    can be explained by patterns of scores across survey questions,
    assessment indicators, or scales. The application of LCA is an
    active area of research and continues to evolve. As more
    researchers begin to apply the approach, detailed information on
    key considerations in conducting LCA is needed. In the present
    article, we describe LCA, review key elements to consider when
    conducting LCA, and provide an example of its application.
